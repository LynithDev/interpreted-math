# Because of implicit variable multiplication, the interpreter 
# does not know if the current 'variable' is one variable or many implicitly declared variables.
# To fix this, you can surround your long variables in square brackets: [var]
# Example:

$a = 3
$apple = 5
apple # Returns 3, and a warning because it couldn't find any variables called "pple"
